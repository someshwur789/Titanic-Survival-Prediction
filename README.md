# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Welcome to my Data Science Internship at CodSoft! In this repository, you will find a Titanic Survival Prediction Project that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. This project showcases my skills in Data Science, Python, matplotlib and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:

This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict Passenger Survival. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and to predict survival probabilities.

The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket
class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
